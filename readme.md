# Shawarmarama

## A Project for Learning Practical Engineering

Shawarmarama is a project for learning and practicing engineering techniques more similar to what
someone would expect to find in the workplace and less similar to a toy project that one might create
as part of a tutorial series or college course. This project is meant for the intermediate developer who
wants to see a bunch of different ideas tied together - feature implementation, testing, a full-stack
project, db management, etc.
